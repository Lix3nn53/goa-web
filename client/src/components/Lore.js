          <h5 class="card-title">Chapter 1: Soleis</h5>
          <p>
            Before everything, even time, there was only one thing. Imos: owner
            of the universe. Nothing can happen out of it's will. But knowing
            everything can be too boring. Imos wanted to create a world which
            events would happen out of his will. So he created Itmars and wanted
            them to draw anything they imagine. They draw water, wind, earth,
            fire and lightning. But one of them wanted his drawing to be on top
            of all drawings. So he drew the darkness. Imos put the drawings
            together and gave them life. Thus was formed the Adelia.
          </p>

          <p>
            There was also things that Itmars didn't drew like humans, elfs,
            dwarfs, hobbits and other creatures. Imos created them to be natives
            of Adelia.
          </p>

          <p>
            But not before long The War of Elements has begun. Even power of all
            elements together weren't enough to suppress darkness. As darkness
            slowly conquer the Adelia many lost their life and many became a
            slave to darkness.
          </p>

          <p>
            Itmars knew it was going to be too late to save Adelia. So they
            decided to sacrifice elements as their last hope. Elements came
            together and put everything into this last attack. This togetherness
            formed the brighest light ever that will be called Soleis the Light
            of Life. Soleis shined brightly on lands of Adelia and suppress the
            darkness forever. Elements and their magical power spread all around
            the Adelia. Creating new life forms, races or effecting living
            beings with magic.
          </p>

          <p>Thus a long era of peace began. </p>

          <p>
            Soleis, the Light of Life, enriched lands of Adelia giving hope to
            us, folks living on it. We built life from scracth. Farms, villages,
            towns, castles followed by kingdoms to rule Adelia.
          </p>

          <p>
            After a long time which The War of Elements only known as a legend,
            natives of Adelia started to forget the sacrifice that brought
            serenity to their lands.
          </p>

          <p>
            Not long after, our kings became a slave to their greed. They used
            their armies which was formed to protect the lands, to conquer them.
            Laid siege to every fortress, they bite and bite away.
          </p>

          <p>
            Men of the Adelia, we stand at the precipice. The kings have failed
            us and yet we do not plead? instead we wail "Why have the gods
            forsaken us?"
          </p>

          <p>
            The nefarious force, dark magic, began to be felt and consume life
            of Adelia again. Yet we did not banish it, instead studying the vile
            arcane for our own power and wealth!
          </p>

          <p>
            Can we chart a course back in to the light? Will we find the
            willpower to banish the darkness? Unite around light of elements?

            The Adelia bleeds, flogged by war. The battles are the gods' whip,
            chastisement for our sins! And within this darkness, the monsters
            are back.. wandering freely.. More and more crowded as we get
            familiar with dark magic. Yet did we raise out swords against them?
            Or have we laid this burden on others?
          </p>

          <p>
            On so called The Guardians. Those who studied elements to bring
            Soleis back to cleanse Adelia again. The last stand against unholy
            relicts of this Darkness. Nigh is the time of the sword and axe!
            none will fight this war in our stead! Nigh is the time of madness
            and disdain!

          <h5 class="card-title">Chapter 4: Eternal Peace</h5>
          <p>
            Far away from the war at Adelia, there was a small elf village named
            Bera. The village folk were afraid but all they could do is hoping
            the war doesn’t reach them. But a child named Aleesia was more
            curious about magical lands of Adelia than she is afraid of war. She
            would escape and make small exploration trips whenever she can.
          </p>

          <p>
            One day the unholy relicts of this war, undeads, attacked Bera. It
            looked like there was no hope for the elf folks.. But Guardians made
            it in time! Slaying the undeads easily, elf town was saved. Aleesia
            were admired by guardians, strong warriors in shiny armours
            protecting her family, her village and all of Adelia. She worked
            hard to become a guardian, so she did. She earned guardians’ respect
            with her skills and leadership in combat and became Ranger General
            of Bera.
          </p>

          <p>
            But her glorious days were coming to an end. An undead army, never
            seen this big before, were charging towards Bera. Aleesia prepared
            The Guardians to defend her town. With her great skills, it was
            looking like Bera had a chance. But then he appeared on an undead
            horse, Makaph the King of Undeads. There was no guardian who can
            face him in combat. Aleesia charged forward to take him down but
            Makaph’s sword sliced through her.
          </p>

          <p>
            Her failure, represented by her own corpse, and the corpses strewn
            around her. The last moments of her life, captured in perfect,
            horrifying clarity – the moments that spurred every action she’s
            taken since. Her soul was captured by Makaph. She can’t move on. She
            can’t look back. She can simply exist, suspended forever in that one
            horrifying moment – the moment that should have been her demise, but
            was not.
          </p>

          <p>
            Makaph the King of Undeads continued to conquer Adelia with his army
            which is getting bigger and bigger by each death. The Guardians had
            to stop them before it is too late. They formed the most glorious
            army of Guardians ever. The Guardians fought good, testing power of
            Makaph in close combat. But Makaph was stronger than they can
            handle. The battle was lost but Makaph’s sword were broken which
            weakened his control over undeads. Thus Aleesia and a few strong
            souls who was killed by Makaph’s sword, gained control over their
            body.
          </p>

          <p>
            How much of Aleesia’s memory still exists? Enough that she remembers
            her family, and time before her death. But the most powerful memory
            – the moment she carries with her always — was that moment of her
            demise. And that is why, when given a choice to do anything at all,
            Aleesia immediately set out to have her revenge.
          </p>

          <p>
            It wasn’t just revenge that Aleesia was trying to accomplish. She
            was trying to undo everything Makaph had done. She gathered the
            other free-willed undead to her side, and gave them a banner to
            fight under. But it didn’t undo what Makaph had done. None of it
            did. When the Undead King fell, Aleesia went to his throne. Only to
            find another sitting on it, herself. Life is pain. Hope fails. She
            understand that even if they form Soleis again and restore peace,
            people can never maintain it. There will always be hatred, greed,
            stupidity to feed the Darkness.
          </p>

          <p>
            What, then, is Aleesia’s, the Undead Queen's, ultimate goal? It may
            very well be peace – but not the kind of peace everyone else
            imagines when they say the word. No, it’s the kind of peace that
            exists in a world without conflict. Without feeling. Without life.
            It’s the cold, absent grasp of undeath – unyielding and unchanging.
            Neither alive nor dead, simply existing, purposeless and unfeeling
            in an absence of want, need, or desire.
